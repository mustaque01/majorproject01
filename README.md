📍 About The Project
In today's fast-paced world, continuous learning is essential for professional growth. However, managing resources and tracking progress can be overwhelming. This Learning Path Dashboard aims to solve that problem by providing a centralized platform for both instructors and learners.

Learners get a personalized dashboard that provides clear, actionable insights into their progress. With detailed statistics and visualizations, users can see how much time they've spent on specific topics, estimate completion times for skills, and stay motivated on their educational journey. The entire application is designed with a strong focus on user experience (UX) to ensure an intuitive and seamless interface.
